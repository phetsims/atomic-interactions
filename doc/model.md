Model Notes for Atomic Interactions
===================================

+ The interaction between the two atoms is modeled using the Lennard-Jones potential.
+ The atomic radius, which corresponds to Ïƒ (sigma), is the Van der Waals radius.
+ When selecting pairs of atoms, the Oxygen-Oxygen selection is the only one in which the atoms bond. When the bond
  forms, the shaking of the left atom is meant to represent the energy transferred away from the bonded pair. In the
  real world, this energy would generally be translated into motion of the O2 molecule.
